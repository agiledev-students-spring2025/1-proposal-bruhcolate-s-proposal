# Sports Stalker
The best way to track your favorite athletes.

## What and why?
Sports Stalker is a web application that allows users to keep track of their favorite athletes. The sports world can be intimidating and fast-paced, so it is sometimes difficult to keep up. Not with Sports Stalker! Users can create new profiles for their favorite athletes and keep tabs on any notable events that involve them.

## For whom?
This app is for anyone who loves sports and want to keep up with what's going on. This can include:
1. Fans of a team who wants to keep up with all players of that team.
2. Fans of multiple players on different teams who want to follow each player.
3. Fans of a sport who want to keep up with the star athletes.
4. New fans to a sport who need help keeping up with everything.
Whether you're a die-hard fan or someone just trying to break into the sports world, Sports Stalker is of use to many people.

## How?
From an end-user perspective, Sports Stalker will...
1. Allow users to create an account and log in.
2. Secure their account with email verification.
3. Create profiles for their any athlete they desire.
4. Manually input news involving the athlete.
5. Create an automatic tracker that looks for the athletes name on the specified website.
6. Users can receive notifications for new mentions of an athlete.
7. Follow other users and view their favorite athletes.
8. Be followed by other users who can view their athletes.
9. Comment on other users posts about their athletes.

## Scope
Sports Stalker is neither too easy nor too ambitious for 4-6 students. The main features require user authentication, email verification, front-end user interface design, and back-end database management. These features are challenging yet still achievable within the provided timeframe. Of course, the project has flexibility if it proves to be too easy or too difficult, though that shouldn't be an issue.
